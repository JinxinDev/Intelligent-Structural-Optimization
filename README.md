## Overview

This repository contains supplementary materials for our research on LLM-integrated structural optimization. The framework coordinates Large Language Models with genetic algorithms (NSGA-II) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to automate the design optimization of structural components through natural language interaction.

### Key Innovations

- üó£Ô∏è **Natural Language Interface**: Engineers formulate complex optimization tasks through conversational queries without specialized expertise
- üß† **Adaptive Parameter Refinement**: LLM agents automatically adjust optimization parameters based on performance feedback, reducing computational time by 76%
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Physics-Based Validation**: Seamless integration with ABAQUS FEA ensures reliable, code-compliant solutions
- üìä **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Generates Pareto-optimal solutions exploring cost-performance trade-offs
- ü§ù **Interactive Decision Support**: Conversational interface for exploring design alternatives and verifying safety requirements

### Performance Highlights

- **88% reduction** in human effort vs. manual design
- **76% reduction** in computational time vs. traditional optimization (50√ó50 parameters)
- **Perfect accuracy** (F1-score = 1.0) on 30 diverse test queries
- **5.2 hours** total time to generate 27 Pareto-optimal solutions

## Framework Architecture

The system comprises three integrated modules:

### 1. Planning Module
Parses natural language queries and determines optimization parameters using agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
- Query processor extracts design requirements
- Agentic RAG retrieves relevant design codes and research findings
- Parameter initialization for NSGA-II and FEA setup

### 2. Implementing Module
Executes structural optimization with physics-based evaluation:
- NSGA-II multi-objective genetic algorithm
- Automated ABAQUS FEA model generation and analysis
- Refinement agent monitors performance and adjusts parameters

### 3. Evaluating Module
Provides conversational analysis and verification:
- Interactive exploration of Pareto front solutions
- ACI 318-25 code compliance verification
- Multi-modal interface (text + images) for design discussion

## Case Study: UHPC Beam Optimization

The framework is demonstrated through Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) beam design, where:
- Underdeveloped design codes necessitate FEA-based evaluation
- Superior material properties enable unconventional designs (e.g., minimal/no stirrups)
- Multi-objective optimization explores
